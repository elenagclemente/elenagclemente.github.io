# Welcome!

I am a PhD student in Economics at the University of Zurich. 

I hold a Bachelor's in Economics and Finance from Bocconi University and a Master's in Economics from the Stockholm School of Economics. Before joining the PhD, I was a Pre-Doctoral Research Analyst at the Swedish House of Finance, working on household finance with Prof. Paolo Sodini and Anastasia Girshina. 

I'm currently working on my website. If you'd like to get in touch, shoot me an email at elena.clemente@econ.uzh.ch! :)
